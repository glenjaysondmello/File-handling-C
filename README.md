# Student Management System

A simple C-based **Student Management System** that allows you to manage student records (insert, update, delete, and select). The records are stored in a text file named `Student.txt`.

## Introduction

This project allows users to manage student records through a command-line interface. You can add, update, delete, and view student records based on their USN (University Seat Number). Each student record consists of a USN, name, and marks.

## Features

- **Insert Student Record**: Adds a new student record to `Student.txt`.
- **Update Student Record**: Updates the details (USN, name, marks) of an existing student record.
- **Delete Student Record**: Deletes a student record based on the USN.
- **Select Student Record**: Displays a specific student record by USN or shows all records.
